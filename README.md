# Psycholigical_Walking_Sim
This is a 3D Psychological Walking Simulator that I have started Developing to get my Head around the basics of Unity 3D and to dive deeper. The project is Highly inspired From the game "When The Darkness Comes". This Projects doesnt contain Shader scripting. Most of the shaders and Vfx are done through the Shader and VFX graph. Render Pipeline Used: Universal Render Pipeline. 
The Game is uploaded on itch.io
